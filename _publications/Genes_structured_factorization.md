Abstract: Motivated by the analysis of complex single-cell gene expression data we propose a Bayesian class of
generalized factor models for high dimensional count data. The developed methodology allows us to
incorporate external knowledge, such as biological pathways, into the model’s prior distribution. This
approach promotes sparsity in the factor loadings facilitating their interpretation and that of the
corresponding latent factors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on single-cell RNA
sequencing data obtained from cord blood mononuclear cells, revealing promising insights into the role of
pathways in characterizing gene relationships and extracting valuable information about unobserved cell traits.
